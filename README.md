# __OST2__.tmbundle
I don’t always bundle but when I do this is how it looks. This is where I keep all my personal miscellaneous TextMate-related minutiae, commands, themes, et cetera, _ad nauseum_.


# Installing
Download the <a href="https://github.com/fish2000/__OST2__.tmbundle/archive/master.zip">ZIP archive</a>, decompress, rename the folder from e.g. `__OST2__.tmbumdle-master` to `__OST2__.tmbundle` – the Finder will warn you about editing a file suffix, pay it no mind – and double-click on what should have just changed from a plain folder to a TextMate bundle icon. TextMate will open, if it hasn’t already, and ask you if you’d like to install the **\_\_OST2\_\_** bundle (which presumably you do).
